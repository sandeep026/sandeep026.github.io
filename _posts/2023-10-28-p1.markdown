- casadi 3.6.3

Consider the unconstrained optimization problem whose objective us defined as,  

$f(x)=(x-5^2)+(y-8)^2$

This is a convex problem with global solution $(x^{\*},y^{\*})=(5,8)$. The following code computes the solution to this problem numerically using IPOPT, an interior-point solver.

Its worth noting the following features of the Opti class.  

1. A modelling language for solving nonlinear optimization problem
2. Interface to several solvers
3. JIT evaluation

```python
import casadi as cs
p=cs.Opti()
w=p.variables(1,2)
x=w[0]
y=w[1]
obj=(x-5)**2+(y-8)**2
p.minimize(obj)
p.solver('ipopt')
sol=p.solve()
print('x*: ',sol.value(x),'x*: ',sol.value(x))
```
```
