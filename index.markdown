I work on numerical methods for nonlinear optimal control problems with emphasis on computing solutions efficiently. Some of the key ingredient in the include **automatic differentiation**, **parallel evaluations**, **C/C++ code generation** and **customized numerical methods** for nonlinear optimization.  
At IIT Madras as a research assistant, I developed tailored optimization algorithms for guidance and control of 6DoF aircraft and tanker ship. Formulation centric methods like differential flatness and optimization centric methods like null space methods were used to create a real-time nonlinear model predictive controller.  
They have been published in top-tier journals. Please refer to my [**publications**](/publications) for more information.
